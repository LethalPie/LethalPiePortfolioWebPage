My name is Eliphalet but call me Eli!  I’m a Software Developer with a passion for innovative solutions and cutting-edge technologies.  I am a prospective graduate from NSCC IT Programming; enthusiastic about launching my career as a Software Developer and making meaningful contributions to the tech industry.  Through my time as a student, I have built a strong foundation in many different programming languages and gained industry experience through internships and projects.

I’m a self driven and detail-oriented individual with a fresh perspective on today’s technology landscape.  As a Software Developer, I am eager to apply my skills to craft innovative solutions and tackle real world challenges.  Whether it is crafting efficient code, collaborating with cross functional teams, or creating a great website; I am committed delivering excellence.

During my time as a student, I had the opportunity to work on several projects that honed my technical skills and deepened my understanding of software development practices.  One of my most rewarding experiences was creating a web application for Michelin North America in 2023. In this experience, I created a more efficient tire production scheduling system and found calculation discrepancies that costed the company in the past.  This equipped me with the practical knowledge and confidence to excel in a professional setting.
